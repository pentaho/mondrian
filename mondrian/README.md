## Welcome to Mondrian
Mondrian is an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) server that enables business users to analyze large quantities of data in real-time.  Mondrian implements the Olap4J API.
### Building
#### Requirements
* JDK 1.8 or higher
* Maven 3.3 or higher
* Docker (for running integration tests without a dedicated MySQL DB)

#### Quick Start
The following command will build the Mondrian jar, run the full integration test suite using a MySQL server running on Docker and install the jar file into your local Maven repository.
```
mvn -DrunITs -P embedded-mysql,load-foodmart install -Djava.locale.providers=COMPAT,SPI
```
Skip the integration tests by omitting `-DrunITs -P embedded-mysql,load-foodmart`

#### Run Isolate Integration Test
```
mvn verify -DrunITs -Dit.test=NonEmptyTest.java -DfailIfNoTests=false -Djava.locale.providers=COMPAT,SPI
```

#### Alternate Foodmart
Mondrian's integration test suite runs queries against the Foodmart database.  It is often needed to run the test suite against a different database, for example, a local DB instance.  You may choose different connection properties by creating a file `mondrian.properties` and specifying jdbc connection properties as follows:
```
mondrian.foodmart.jdbcURL=jdbc:mysql://yourServerName/yourDatabaseName
mondrian.foodmart.jdbcUser=yourUser
mondrian.foodmart.jdbcPassword=yourPassword
```
###### Getting JDBC Drivers
The Maven build has a test dependency on the MySql jdbc driver.  If you want to use a different DBMS you will need to add the jdbc driver to the test dependencies using a Maven profile.  The profile should be defined in your settings.xml file.  Example profile:
```
...
    <profile>
      <id>usePostgres</id>
      <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
          <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
          <version>9.3-1102-jdbc4</version>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>
    </profile>
...
```
    
###### Loading Foodmart
When using the Docker MySQL databse, Foodmart will be populated automatically during the integration-test phase of the build.  When you're using an alternate Foodmart you can populate your database before the test suite runs by activating the Maven profile `load-foodmart`.  The following command will compile Mondrian, build a jar file, load foodmart into the configured database and run the integration test suite.
```
mvn -DrunITs -Pload-foodmart verify 
```
Once Foodmart is loaded, you don't need to load it on subsequent builds, so you can omit activation of the load-foodmart profile.

#### CmdRunner
Mondrian provides a command line utility for executing MDX queries.  It can often be helpful for debugging.  CmdRunner requires that you have setup a mondrian.properties file.  At present, it cannot run with the embedded MySql server.  The required properties are:
```
mondrian.foodmart.jdbcURL=jdbc:mysql://yourServerName/yourDatabaseName
mondrian.foodmart.jdbcUser=yourUser
mondrian.foodmart.jdbcPassword=yourPassword
mondrian.catalogURL=../demo/FoodMart.xml
```
The Maven profile `cmdrunner` will build Mondrian, skip the test suite and execute CmdRunner.
```
mvn -Pcmdrunner
```
#### Advanced Configuration
Mondrian has many additional configuration options that can be specified in `mondrian.properties`.  The complete set of options as well as documentation on how to use them gets generated during the generate-sources phase of the Maven build.
```
mvn generate-sources
```
The `target` folder will now contain a file `mondrian.properties.template`.  All supported properties are explained there.  You can use any of them in your `mondrian.properties` file, but be aware that some tests will explicitly override some of these properties.
