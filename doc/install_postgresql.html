			<h2>
			1. About these installation notes
			<A name="01-AboutTheNotes">&nbsp;</A>
            </h2>

			<p>The binary distribution of Mondrian 1.1.5 works well with little
			or no tweaking, with the Access database (.mdb file) provided with
			the distribution. Getting it to work with PostgreSQL however,
			requires some tweaking, and the most reliable way to get it up and
			running is to rebuild the &quot;mondrian.war&quot; from the source (available
			as part of the binary distribution).
				<BR><BR>

				These installation notes will help you install Mondrian in the
			following environment: <BR>

				</p>

				<UL>
				<LI><STRONG>OS</STRONG>: Windows XP/2000 (for database and
				servlet container)</LI>
				<LI><STRONG>JDK</STRONG>: JDK 1.5.0_01</LI>
				<LI><STRONG>Database</STRONG>: PostgreSQL 8.0</LI>
				<LI><STRONG>Servlet container</STRONG>: Tomcat 5.0.28</LI>
				</UL>

				You should still be able to use these installation instructions
			with variations in the above environment (e.g., a different version
			of Tomcat or a different version of PostgreSQL, etc.). However, it
			is more than likely that in case of version differences, some steps
			may either be redundant (e.g., if you are installing on a higher
			version of Tomcat) or some steps may be missing (e.g., if you are
			installing on a lower version of Tomcat).<p>These notes have been produced based on <strong>
				<a href="install.html#Appendix_B_Patrick_Tallmans_installation_instructions">
			Patrick Tallman's instructions for installing on Windows</a></strong>.
			Those instructions appear to be based on Mondrian 1.0.1 and
			therefore appeared out of sync with Mondrian 1.1.5. These notes
			retain significant portions of Patrick Tallman's instructions, but
			excludes portions that are now redundant and addresses some issues
			not specifically addressed earlier. The instructions have also been
			reorganized.</p>
<p>Please note the use of the following symbols in this document:</p>
<p><span class="caution">[!]</span>: indicates an
			instruction/observation that requires special attention (either
			because you must be careful with the version or because it can
			result in a common human error).</p>
<p><span class="notice">[#]</span>: indicates an
			explanation/special notice usually intended to explain a particular
			approach or remind you of a previous situation.

			Section 2: Download and extract the distribution files
			------------------------------------------------------------>

			</p>

			<h2>2. Download and extract the distribution files<a name="02-DownloadDistribution">&nbsp;</a></h2>
			Along with the Mondrian distribution, you must also download the
			JPivot distribution because the build script uses a .war file from
			the JPivot distribution. The distribution is available at the
			following URLs:

				<UL>
					<LI><STRONG>Mondrian</STRONG>: <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mondrian" title="Click here to get the latest version of Mondrian">
					http://sourceforge.net/projects/mondrian</A> - download
					Mondrian 1.1.5 from this URL</LI>
					<LI><STRONG>JPivot</STRONG>: <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpivot" title="Click here to get the latest version of JPivot">
					http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpivot/</A> - download &quot;JPivot
					Web Frontend&quot; from this URL</LI>
				</UL>
<p>Once you have downloaded the distribution files, extract them as
			follows:
				</p>
				<OL>
					<LI>Extract the contents of <strong>mondrian-1.1.5.zip</strong>.
					This will create a folder called &quot;<span class="code">mondrian-1.1.5</span>&quot;.
					It is recommended that you rename this to &quot;<span class="code">mondrian-1.1.5-bin</span>&quot;. <U>
					This is only for housekeeping purposes and has no bearing
					whatsoever on the installation process</U>. This folder
					(either &quot;<span class="code">mondrian-1.1.5</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="code">mondrian-1.1.5-bin/</span>&quot;,
					depending on whether you chose to rename the directory or
					not) will hereinafter be referred to as <span class="code"><strong>
					%BIN_LOCATION%</strong></span>.<BR>&nbsp;</LI>
					<LI>Create a folder called &quot;<span class="code">mondrian-1.1.5-src</span>&quot;

					(located in &quot;<span class="code">%BIN_LOCATION%/dist/</span>&quot;)

					All contents will automatically get created in the folder &quot;<span class="code">mondrian-1.1.5-src/mondrian-1.1.5/</span>&quot;.
					If you wish, for disambiguity and ease of housekeeping, you
					may move all contents from &quot;<span class="code">mondrian-1.1.5-src/mondrian-1.1.5/</span>&quot;
					directly into &quot;<span class="code">mondrian-1.1.5-src/</span>&quot;.

			Section 3: Set up your environment
			------------------------------------------------------------>

			<h2>3. Set up your environment<a name="03-SetUpEnvironment">&nbsp;</a></h2>

<p>This section walks you through the
			steps to set up your environment to build the Mondrian web archive.
			As part of setting up the environment, you need to ensure that you
			have the resources described in this section. If you do not have the
			latest/recommended versions, you may need to download them from the
			URLs specified. Once you have downloaded these resources, you must
			set up certain environment variables.
				</p>
<h4>Resources</h4>
<p>You will need (to download) the following in order to set up
			your environment: </p>
				<UL>
					<LI><STRONG>JDK</STRONG>: <A href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp" title="Click here to download JDK 1.5">
					JDK 1.5 or higher (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp)</A></LI>
					<LI><STRONG>Servlet container</STRONG>: <A href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/downloads/downloads_tomcat-5.cgi" title="Click here to download a version of Tomcat 5.0+">
					Tomcat 5.x</A></LI>
					<LI><STRONG>Database</STRONG>: <A href="http://www.pervasivepostgres.com/downloads/" title="Click here to get the latest version of Postgres">
					PostgreSQL 8.0 or higher (http://www.pervasivepostgres.com/downloads/
					or http://www.postgresql.org/download/)</A></LI>
					<LI><STRONG>JDBC driver</STRONG>: <A href="http://jdbc.postgresql.org/" title="Click here to get the JDBC driver for Postgres">
					PostgreSQL JDBC driver (http://jdbc.postgresql.org/)</A></LI>
				</UL>

				<p>Typically, the above will suffice if you need to merely deploy a
			binary distribution that you have downloaded. In order to build the
			&quot;<span class="code">mondrian.war</span>&quot; from source, you will
			require the following additional resources.
				</p>
<p><span class="caution">[!]</span> While variations of the
			database (and therefore of the JDBC driver) or of the servlet
			container are possible, the following cannot be changed in the
			deployment environment since there is a strong dependency on these
			packages/components.
				<br>

				</p>

				<UL>
					<LI><STRONG>Xalan</STRONG>: <A href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/" title="Click here to get the latest version of Xalan">
					Xalan 2.7.0 or higher recommended (http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/)</A>
					(Xalan is an XSLT processor that helps you convert XML
					documents into other formats; typically, HTML)</LI>
					<LI><STRONG>Ant</STRONG>: <A href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/binaries/" title="Click here to get Ant 1.5.x">
					Ant 1.5.x (http://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/binaries/)</A>.
						<BR><span class="caution">[!]</span> The latest release
					is Ant 1.6.5, but a few problems have been reported with
					this version. It is therefore recommended that you use 1.5.x</LI>
					<LI><STRONG>JUnit</STRONG>: <A href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/junit/junit3.8.1.zip?download" title="Click here to download JUnit 3.8.1">
					JUnit - 3.8.x recommended (http://www.junit.org/index.htm)</A></LI>
				</UL>
<p>It is likely that one or more of these components or an older
			version of it, is already installed on your system. Please contact
			your System Administrator if you need help finding out if you have
			an older version, or with installation of any of these softwares
			that you have to download. Installation instructions for each of the
			above are available on the respective websites from which you will
			download these resources. </p>
<h4>Environment variables</h4>
<p>Once you have installed/ascertained that you have all the above
			components, you must set up some environment variables (these are
			used by the build script):

				</p>

				<UL>
					<LI>ANT_HOME</LI>
					<LI>CATALINA_HOME</LI>
					<LI>JAVA_HOME</LI>
					<LI>JUNIT_HOME</LI>
					<LI>XALAN_HOME</LI>
				</UL>
<p>You may skip this step (setting up environment variables) if you
			wish, but you must then take care of it in the build script. It is
			strongly recommended that you address this at this point by setting
			up environment variables, unless you have a strong reason not to do
			so.</p>

			<h2>4. Load the test database<a name="04-LoadTestDB">&nbsp;</a></h2>

            <p>The Mondrian distribution is accompanied by a test database (the
			classic &quot;Foodmart&quot; database). This database must be loaded for you
			run the examples available with the distribution. You will have to
			make use of the following resources from the distribution to load
			the database.</p>
<UL>
					<LI><span class="code"><STRONG>
					mondrian.test.loader.MondrianFoodMartLoader</STRONG></span>:
