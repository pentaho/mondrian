<!--
     A NameMatcher is a CaseMatcher that prepends and appends
     regular expressions to a given string as part of creating
     the matching regular expression. Both the pre/post
     regular expression can be null in which case matches are
     applied simply against the name (modulo case considerations).
     The purpose of this class is to allow aggregate tables to
     be identified when their table names are formed by placing
     text before and/or after the base fact table name.

     This allows one to create an element that matches against a

     Only one rule can be applied to a given connection. In

     It is very important that the AggRules validate method is called

<!--
     This element is used in a vector of child elements when
     one wishes to have one or more regular expressions associated
     with matching a given string. The parent element must
     initialize Regex object by calling its validate method
     passing in an array of template names.
     The cdata content is a regular expression with embedded
     template names. Each name must be surrounded by "${" and "}".
     Each time this is used for a new set of names, the names
     replace the template names in the regular expression.
     For example, if the charcase="lower", the attribute
     dot="-" (the default dot value is "_"), the template names are:
     "city", "state", and "country"
     and the cdata is:
     .*_${country}_.*_${city}
     Then when the names:
     "San Francisco", "California", and "U.S.A"
     are passed in, the regular expression becomes:
     .*_u-s-a_.*_san_francisco
     Note that a given template name can only appear ONCE in the
     template content, the cdata content. As an example, the
     following cdata template is not supported:
     .*_${country}_.*_${city}_${country}

     A RolapConnection uses one AggRule. If no name is specified, then
     the AggRule which is marked as default==true is used (validation
     fails if one and only one AggRule is not marked as the default).
     An AggRule has manditory child elements for matching the
     aggregate table names, aggregate table fact count column,
     foreign key columns, the measure columns, and the hierarchy level
     columns. These child elements can be specified as direct children
     of an AggRule element or by reference to elements defined as a
     pier to the AggRule (using references allows reuse of the child
     elements and with one quick edit the reference to use can be
     changed by changing the refid attribute value).
