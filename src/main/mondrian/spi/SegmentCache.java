/**
 * SPI definition of the segments cache.
 *
 * <p>Lookups are performed using {@link SegmentHeader}s and
 * {@link SegmentBody}s. Both are immutable and fully serializable.
 *
 * <p>There are a few ways to declare a SegmentCache implementation in
 * Mondrian. The first one is to set the
 * {@link MondrianProperties#SegmentCache} property.
 *
 * <p>The second one is to use the Java Services API. This is the preferred
 * mean. You will need to create a jar file, accessible through the same
 * class loader as Mondrian, and add a file called
 * <code>/META-INF/services/mondrian.spi.SegmentCache</code> which contains
 * the name of the segment cache implementation to use.
 *
 * <p>The third method is to use the {@link SegmentCacheInjector}.
 * This is to be used as a last resort, in environments where the
 * cache implementation is not part of the same class loader as Mondrian.
 * In those cases, Mondrian can't dynamically load the segment cache class.
 * The injector serves as an IoC-like service.
 *
 * <p>All of the segment caches that Mondrian discovers, throughout all
 * of these means of discovery, will be used simultaneously. It is not possible
 * to register new segment caches for a previously existing instance
 * of a Mondrian server. The caches are scanned and configured when each
 * Mondrian instance gets created.
 *
 * <p>Implementations are expected to be thread-safe. Mondrian is likely to
 * submit multiple requests at the same time, from different threads. It is the
 * responsibility of the cache implementation to maintain a consistent
 * state.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations must implement a time-out policy, if needed. Mondrian
 * knows that a call to the cache might take a while. (Mondrian uses worker
 * threads to call into the cache for precisely that reason.) Left to its
 * own devices, Mondrian will wait forever for a call to complete. The cache
 * implementation might know that a call to {@link #get} that has taken 100
 * milliseconds already is probably hung, so it should return null or throw
 * an exception. Then Mondrian can get on with its life, and get the segment
 * some other way.</p>
 *
 * <p>Implementations must provide a default empty constructor.
 * Mondrian creates one segment cache instance per Mondrian server.
 * There could be more than one Mondrian server running in the same JVM.
