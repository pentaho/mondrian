Mondrian 3.4.0-GA production release notes
=============================================

Introduction
------------

Mondrian 3.4.0-GA is a major refactoring of Mondrian's internals
and the way it handles & stores the cell data. This release makes
Mondrian much more scalable and much more effective in the way it
uses the system threads.

This release also introduces a new algorithm to load, share and
rollup the data cells, or segments. Mondrian will rollup and union
the segment data from low levels, in memory, to answer queries
related to higher levels. This provides a huge improvement in
performance on systems with high user interactivity.

It is also worth noting that the Mondrian project now hosts its
source code on github. The official source code can now be found
at: github.com/pentaho/mondrian

Contents
--------

As usual, there are two distributions for this release:
 * mondrian-<version>.zip contains the FoodMart dataset in
   SQL and Access format
 * mondrian-<version>-derby.zip contains the FoodMart
   dataset as an Apache Derby database

Each distribution contains the full mondrian source code, as
mondrian-<version>-src.zip, documentation including
generated API documentation, and a web archive mondrian.war.
This web archive contains all classes and libraries (jars)
necessary to run mondrian.

This release runs on Java version 1.5 and higher. For
backwards compatibility on Java 1.4, substitute
mondrian-jdk14.jar for mondrian.jar, and add
retroweaver-rt-1.2.4.jar to your classpath.

For further installation instructions, see
http://mondrian.pentaho.com/documentation/installation.php
or the included file doc/installation.html.

Main functionality in this release
----------------------------------
 - Support for olap4j 1.0.1 and JDBC 4.1.
 - Simplified and improved the SegmentCache SPI.
 - Introduces the Mondrian Monitor API.
 - Refactored some key parts of the engine into an
   implementation of the Actor design pattern, providing more
   effective resource sharing and the elimination of many
   synchronization blocks.
 - SQL queries for cell data is now fetched by a multi-threaded
   executor and the tasks are shared among the query threads.
 - More than one SegmentCache implementations can now be used
   at a time.
 - Ability to combine the data of multiple segments for a single
   query.
 - Ability to combine data of an existing segment with data form SQL.
 - Support for the DRILLTHROUGH RETURN clause.
 - Ability to define non-measure calculated members in a cube
   under a specific parent.
 - Allow aggregate tables to join to middle levels of snowflake
   dimension.
 - As usual, many other bug fixes and performance tweaks.

Bugs and feature requests fixed for 3.2.1.13885
----------------------------------------------------------
MONDRIAN-821 - Adds a unique ID property to the Schema API. This id 
               is expected to be different across different Mondrian
               instances. It allows clients to refresh their schema
               caches when that ID changes. This usually happened 
               when a dynamic schema processor is used and the schema 
               changes when a user login changes.
MONDRIAN-695 - NonEmpty, Crossjoin and multiple dimensions in a slicer 
               all together were returning wrong results with native 
               sets.
