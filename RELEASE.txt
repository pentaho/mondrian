Mondrian 3.5.0-GA production release notes
=============================================

Introduction
------------

Mondrian 3.5.0 is a bugfix release based off the previous 3.4.1 version.
It includes many enhancements and performance fixes as well as better
native support for native resolution of tuples when access controls
are added.

We have also significantly improved the performance when dealing with
levels of high cardinality as well as enabled Mondrian to run into
a real-time mode where nothing gets cached and the data it returns
is always the latest from the source.

To find out more about Mondrian, go to http://mondrian.pentaho.com.

Contents
--------

As usual, there are two distributions for this release:
 * mondrian-<version>.zip contains the FoodMart dataset in
   SQL and Access format
 * mondrian-<version>-derby.zip contains the FoodMart
   dataset as an Apache Derby database

Each distribution contains the full mondrian source code, as
mondrian-<version>-src.zip, documentation including
generated API documentation, and a web archive mondrian.war.
This web archive contains all classes and libraries (jars)
necessary to run mondrian.

For further installation instructions, see
http://mondrian.pentaho.com/documentation/installation.php
or the included file doc/installation.html.

Main functionality in this release
----------------------------------
 - Tuples evaluation now push down natively the constraints
   imposed by roles.
 - Fixes some issues in the way Mondrian was splitting segments
   across multiple sub-segments.
 - Resolving tuples only joins to the fact table if absolutely
   necessary.
 - Improved processing of large volumes of data when a member grant
   is used with a partial rollup policy.
 - Enables a mode in which nothing gets cached and the data returned
   is always the latest available from the database.
 - Allows more than one measure to be included in the RETURN clause
   of a DRILLTHROUGH statement.
 - Added support for native evaluation of regular expressions with
   Netezza.
 - Upgraded Apache Xerces.

API changes from 3.4.1 to 3.5.0
---------------------------
 - Changes to the effects of the property 'mondrian.rolap.DisableCache'
 - Introduces a new property to disable the default in-memory cache
   for segments.
 - Added a new method to specify the roles for a connection to allow
   the presence of commas in role names.
 - Allows to specify a minimum TTL value for schemas in the pool through
   connection properties.
 - Allows to specify a unique connection UUID to force the usage of a
   specific schema in the pool through connection properties.

See CHANGES.txt for a list of all source code changes
since the previous release.


Mondrian 3.4.0-GA production release notes
=============================================

Introduction
------------

Mondrian 3.4.0-GA is a major refactoring of Mondrian's internals
and the way it handles & stores the cell data. This release makes
Mondrian much more scalable and much more effective in the way it
uses the system threads.

This release also introduces a new algorithm to load, share and
rollup the data cells, or segments. Mondrian will rollup and union
the segment data from low levels, in memory, to answer queries
related to higher levels. This provides a huge improvement in
performance on systems with high user interactivity.

It is also worth noting that the Mondrian project now hosts its
source code on github. The official source code can now be found
at: github.com/pentaho/mondrian

   executor and the tasks are shared among the query threads.
 - More than one SegmentCache implementations can now be used
   at a time.
 - Ability to combine the data of multiple segments for a single
   query.
 - Ability to combine data of an existing segment with data form SQL.

----------------------------------------------------------
MONDRIAN-821 - Adds a unique ID property to the Schema API. This id 
               is expected to be different across different Mondrian
               instances. It allows clients to refresh their schema
               caches when that ID changes. This usually happened 
               when a dynamic schema processor is used and the schema 
               changes when a user login changes.
MONDRIAN-695 - NonEmpty, Crossjoin and multiple dimensions in a slicer 
               all together were returning wrong results with native
